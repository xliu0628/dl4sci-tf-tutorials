# Notes

## 1. How to improve the accuracy
  - change (usually) increase the number of hidden layers or # of neutrons in the hidden layer
  - change loss function

## 2. Overfitting and Underfitting 
- If you train for too long though, the model will start to overfit and learn patterns from the training data that don't generalize to the test data. 
- Prevent overfitting: more data; if not, regularization.
